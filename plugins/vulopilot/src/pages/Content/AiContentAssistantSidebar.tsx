/**
 * "AI Content Assistant" — a real chat, `POST /content-assistant/chat`
 * (classes/RestAPI/Controllers/ContentAssistant.php), which sends the
 * conversation through the same real AI request sender
 * (AI\AiRequestSender) AI Actions/GEO scoring already use. VuloCloud answers
 * for real once this site is connected (`AiCreditsConnection::is_connected()`,
 * Settings → Connections); when it isn't, `sendToAi()` below recognizes that exact
 * real "No AI connection is configured." condition and opens
 * ConnectVuloCloudPopup — the same real free "Connect to VuloCloud/Claim
 * free AI Credits" flow AiCreditsIndicator.tsx's own dropdown already
 * offers — instead of a dead-end NoticeManager error toast. Every other
 * real error (a safety-validator rejection, a provider's own failure)
 * still shows as that toast. The running conversation (`turns`) is kept
 * client-side and
 * sent back as `history` on every call — there's no conversation entity
 * in this codebase to persist it against; every real call is still
 * recorded to `vulopilot_ai_history` server-side regardless (Reports'
 * own AI Usage report already reads that table). Prompt chips prefill
 * the composer only, same harmless pattern as AI Copilot's ChatTab.tsx.
 *
 * A "write a blog"/"create a landing page"/"create a product description"
 * style message doesn't come back as raw generated text: the controller
 * runs the real AIAction (generate-blog/generate-landing-page/
 * generate-product-description — the same ones ContentToolsGrid.tsx's own
 * tiles run), actually creates and saves the WordPress draft, and this
 * response's `link` carries the real edit URL, rendered below as a real
 * clickable `<a>` — never markdown-in-text, since ChatMessage
 * renders `content` as plain text.

	 * unanswered re-ran this and appended a 2nd, identical "assistant"
	 * turn — confirmed live: 4 clicks on "Write a blog" stacked 4 copies
	 * of "What should the blog be about?" in the chat. One open question
	 * at a time is the real, correct behavior; the user must answer (or
	 * the request must finish) before another chip can ask a new one.
	 *
	 * Checked up front, before even asking the clarifying question — per
	 * direct instruction ("when click work on description then the
	 * connect popup show, not functionality work until the account is
	 * connected"): picking a chip with no AI service connected opens
	 * ConnectVuloCloudPopup immediately, rather than walking through a
