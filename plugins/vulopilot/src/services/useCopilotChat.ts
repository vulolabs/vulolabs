 * "make this section login popup dependency not pro also code in free for
 * this section not pro dependency with login popup") — the real chat
 * backend for AI Copilot's Chat tab (ChatTab.tsx), the one real remaining
 * consumer of this hook (GEO/OverviewTab.tsx used to have its own "How
 * would you like to grow today?" composer built on this same hook too, but
 * that layout was replaced in an earlier session — see that file's own
 * docblock). The running conversation (`turns`) is still kept here,
 * client-side, and sent back as `history` on every call — but every real
 * call also really persists to `vulopilot_ai_conversations` server-side
 * (Copilot.php's own persist_conversation()), keyed by `conversationId`
 * below, which is what lets loadConversation() reload a real, full past
 * thread (not just an excerpt) after a refresh or a brand-new session.
 * Every real call is *separately* still recorded to `vulopilot_ai_history`
 * too, unchanged — that table stays a permanent, excerpt-only audit trail
 * (AiRequestSender::record_success()), not the source this hook
 * reloads from.
 *
 * A message like "write a blog about X" really creates and saves a
 * WordPress draft (Copilot.php's own ContentCreationOrchestrator hand-off,
 * shared with the separate "Create Content" page) — that reply's `link`
 * carries the real edit URL, which ChatTab.tsx renders as a real clickable
 * link, same as AiContentAssistantSidebar.tsx already does for its own
 * identical `link` field. Every other kind of request is still advice-only,
 * per build_messages()'s own system prompt.
 *
 * `send()`'s own `autoApply` (from ChatTab.tsx's "Auto-applies (with
 * approval)" toggle) is sent as `auto_apply` and is what actually gates
 * the one real content-creation capability above — previously local UI
 * state with no server effect at all. When off, Copilot.php describes what
 * it would create instead of creating it, same "advice-only" shape every
 * other kind of request already gets.
 *
 * Genuinely free, not Pro-gated: `send()` only needs a real AI service
 * configured (BYOK under Settings → Connections, or a connected VuloCloud
 * account) — the same gate ContentAssistant.php's own chat and
 * ContentToolsGrid.tsx's free tiles already use. `useAiCredits()`'s
 * `status.connected` is checked up front, before ever calling the API
 * (per the same "check before sending, don't wait for a real failure"
 * posture AiContentAssistantSidebar.tsx's own handleChipClick() already
 * documents), setting `isCloudConnectPromptOpen` instead of making a
 * request that would just fail. As defense-in-depth, a real send that
 * still comes back with Copilot.php's own "No AI connection is configured."
 * error (e.g. `creditsStatus` hadn't loaded yet, or the connection dropped
 * between the check and the request) opens the same popup instead of a
 * dead-end error toast. ChatTab.tsx reads `isCloudConnectPromptOpen` to
 * show the same real `ConnectVuloCloudPopup` every other free AI surface
 * in this plugin uses for this exact condition.
 *
 * @param noticeKey Unique NoticeManager key for this composer's error banner, so two composers on the same page (if that ever happens) don't clobber each other's notice.
