/**
 * The top-level contract for a VuloPilot extension — vulopilot-pro, or any
 * third-party plugin, registered via the `vulopilot_extension_sources`
 * filter (Sdk\ExtensionManager). An extension is a coherent *bundle*: it
 * doesn't scan/rule/automate/report anything itself — register() is where
 * it calls `add_filter('vulopilot_scanner_sources', ...)` and the other
 * existing per-concern filters (SCANNERS.md, RULE-ENGINE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md's
 * "Extension system = the discovery-by-filter mechanism itself") to add its
 * own scanners/rules/automation pieces/report types. This
 * interface adds exactly what those lower-level filters don't have on
 * their own: a stable identity, a version, and a declared minimum
 * VuloPilot version so ExtensionManager can gate registration on real
 * compatibility instead of assuming every registered class is safe to run
 * against any installed core version.
