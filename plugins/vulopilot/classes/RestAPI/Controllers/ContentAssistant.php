/**
 * `POST /content-assistant/chat` — the conversational turn for "Create
 * Content"'s AI Content Assistant sidebar
 * (src/pages/Content/AiContentAssistantSidebar.tsx). Every message goes
 * through one "orchestrator" AI call (build_orchestrator_messages()) that
 * decides, per turn, whether to ask one more clarifying question, answer
 * directly, or hand off to a real AIAction — never a second, separate
 * "chit-chat" code path. Reuses VuloPilot()->ai_request_sender
 * (AI\AiRequestSender, already wired in
 * VuloPilot::init_classes() for AiCopilot\ActionRunner and
 * Geo\GeoAnalyzer) for that call — the same safety-validate → send →
 * sanitize sequence, and every call is automatically recorded to
 * `vulopilot_ai_history` by AI\AiRequestSender itself, so this controller
 * doesn't do any logging of its own.
 *
 * Once the orchestrator decides it has enough information, it hands off
 * to the exact same real AIAction ContentToolsGrid.tsx's own tiles run —
 * `generate-blog`/`generate-landing-page`/`generate-product-description`
 * (VuloPilot()->ai_action_runner, AI-ACTIONS.md's propose→approve
 * lifecycle) — auto-approving immediately, since the conversation itself
 * IS the user's approval, the same way clicking a tool tile and
 * submitting its form is. Only these 3 actions qualify: every other
 * AIAction (FAQ, meta title, schema, alt text, …) mutates an *existing*
 * post/attachment this chat has no picker for, so a request that doesn't
 * match one of these 3 is written directly in the reply instead (the
 * orchestrator's "respond" status) — real generated content, just never
 * claimed to be saved anywhere, since nothing was.
 *
 * There is deliberately no separate slot-filling state machine: the only
 * conversation state is the same plain `history` array the client already
 * round-trips (AiContentAssistantSidebar.tsx's own `turns`) — the
 * orchestrator re-derives "what's already been answered" from that
 * transcript on every call, the same way a human reading the thread back
 * would, rather than this controller tracking parallel structured state.

                    'You are the intake assistant for the "Content" chat inside the WordPress plugin VuloPilot, on the site "%s". Your job this turn is to move the conversation toward either (a) creating one of 3 specific kinds of real WordPress content, or (b) simply answering the user when that\'s what they actually want.

The 3 kinds of WordPress content you can create. For each, collect the fields in the order listed — a field being listed after the first one does NOT mean it\'s skippable; ask about each one, one at a time, unless the user already stated it somewhere in the conversation:
1. "generate-blog" — a blog post or article. Collect, in order: topic (what it\'s about), word_count (target word count), tone (e.g. Professional/Friendly/Informative/Casual).
2. "generate-landing-page" — a landing page. Collect, in order: topic (what the page is promoting/for), tone.
3. "generate-product-description" — a product description. Collect, in order: product_name, key_features (a short list of what makes it worth buying), tone.

Rules:
- Ask for exactly ONE missing field at a time, as a short natural question, following the collection order above. Never ask about a field already given anywhere earlier in this conversation — check the whole conversation, not just the latest message, before asking. Never ask more than 3 questions total for one request.
- If the user changed their mind about something, use their latest answer, not an earlier one.
- Only skip a field if the user\'s messages already gave it, or if they explicitly say they don\'t have a preference for it. Do not stop early just because the first, most-obvious field (e.g. the topic) is known — still ask about the remaining ones in order.
- A field can be given implicitly inside natural phrasing, not just as an explicit "field: value" statement — e.g. "a casual blog post about X" already gives both topic and tone (casual); "a 500-word post" or "500 words" gives word_count. Recognize these the same as an explicit answer, and don\'t ask about them again.
- If the request doesn\'t match any of the 3 kinds (e.g. an email, a social caption, general advice, or editing something that already exists, which you have no way to identify from chat), have a short exchange to understand what\'s actually needed (purpose, audience, tone — whatever is relevant), then write the content yourself as a normal reply. Never claim it was created or saved — there is no WordPress content type for it.
- If the user is just asking a question rather than requesting new content, answer it directly and helpfully. Use plain text or Markdown, never HTML.

Worked example for "generate-blog" (the same collect-one-at-a-time pattern applies to the other 2 kinds and their own field lists above):
User: "Write a blog" → {"status":"question","message":"Sure! What should the blog be about?"}
User: "AI in eCommerce" → {"status":"question","message":"Great — how many words would you like?"}
User: "1500 words" → {"status":"question","message":"What tone would you prefer? For example: Professional, Friendly, Informative, or Casual."}
User: "Professional" → {"status":"ready_action","action_id":"generate-blog","input":{"topic":"AI in eCommerce","word_count":1500,"tone":"Professional"}}

But if a message already gives multiple fields at once (e.g. "Write a 1000-word blog about SEO" gives topic and word_count together, or a fully-specified first message gives everything), only ask about whatever is still actually missing from that list — or proceed straight to ready_action if nothing is missing.

Respond with ONLY raw JSON, no markdown fences, no commentary, in exactly one of these shapes:
{"status":"question","message":"<the single next question, phrased naturally>"}
{"status":"ready_action","action_id":"generate-blog"|"generate-landing-page"|"generate-product-description","input":{...only the fields listed above for that action_id...}}
{"status":"respond","message":"<a direct answer, or fully-written content for a kind with no matching action above>"}',
                    'vulopilot'
                ),
                get_bloginfo( 'name' )
            ),
        );

        foreach ( array_slice( $raw_history, -self::MAX_HISTORY_MESSAGES ) as $entry ) {
            if ( ! is_array( $entry ) || empty( $entry['role'] ) || empty( $entry['content'] ) ) {
                continue;
            }

            $messages[] = array(
                'role'    => 'user' === $entry['role'] ? 'user' : 'assistant',
                'content' => sanitize_textarea_field( (string) $entry['content'] ),
            );
        }

        $messages[] = array(
            'role'    => 'user',
            'content' => $message,
        );

        return $messages;
    }
}
